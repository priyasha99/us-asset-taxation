# What All Forms Need to Be Filled?

For all the incomes mentioned in types of foreign incomes, tax filing needs to be done. There are multiple forms that need to be filled in order to show all these incomes.

## Two Categories

### 1. Foreign Assets
- Relatively easy to file
- Only need to fill one form: **Schedule FA**
- Declares: I own so many assets in the US (all RSUs will be declared here)

### 2. Foreign Income
- Dividend
- Bank account in US with deposits generating interest
- Buying/selling shares of foreign companies via apps like IndMoney

You have to fill:
- **Schedule OS**: OS = Other Sources of Income (same as savings account interest)
- **Schedule FSI**: Since this is a special OS
- **Schedule TR**: Tax Relief. For example, if you have a dividend of $1000, 25% is retained by the US govt as tax ($250 taken). When you declare this $1000 in your ITR as dividend income, if you get taxed again by India for that $1000 (according to your tax bracket), you will be paying tax twice. To avoid that, India has a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with 72 countries, including the US. There are two kinds of variations for this DTAA:
  - **Full Exemption**: If you pay tax in the other country, you do not pay anything here.
  - **Tax Credit**: If you paid 25% in the US, and in India your slab is 15%, you can claim a rebate.
- **Form 67**: Tells the Indian govt that you have foreign income, the country is the US, these are the rules they follow for deducting tax, and this is the tax you have paid in the US.

**NOTE:**
- **TCS**: Introduced in the last 2 years. If you invest more than 7 lakhs (now extended to 10 lakhs) in foreign assets in a year, you have to declare those investments.
- It will automatically get populated, but you need to verify. **Form 27D** needs to be filled.
